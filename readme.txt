Safely embed responsive IFrames in the WordPress text editor.

== Description ==

Fillet adds a new IFrame button to the toolbar in the WordPress visual editor. By using a [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode), it allows for safer, responsive and future proof embeds.

The chosen width and height for an IFrame embed is converted into a ratio which is used to scale your embeds across different devices.
